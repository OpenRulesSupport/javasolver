3) Changes and Bug Fixes:

March, 2010. The search Time Limit originally defined in seconds has been changed to
support milliseconds

March-2010: An error was found in constrainer/impl/IntExpArrayElement1.java
The test /tests/TestElementConstraint.java triggered an java.lang.RuntimeException: 
Invalid elementAt-expression: [A[10] B[4..10] C[7..10]][ind[0..2]]. 
java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException: 7
The fix: in the line 944 of IntExpArrayElement1:935 
"min < values[valCounter-1]" had been replaced with "min <= values[valCounter-1]"
The TestIntExpElementAt1.java works fine.
